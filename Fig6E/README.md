### Instructions to generate Figure 6E.
[This](https://github.com/dvalenzano/Interactive-Sessions/blob/master/09-Dec-2014.py) script is used to generate 
both [m_selectedG.csv](https://github.com/dvalenzano/Fig6/blob/master/m_selectedG.csv) and [f_selectedG.csv](https://github.com/dvalenzano/Fig6/blob/master/f_selectedG.csv).   
[control-survG.r](https://github.com/dvalenzano/R-sessions/blob/master/control-survG.R) is the R file that generated Figure 6E as well as S6I.
